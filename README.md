Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3

Description:
I used different kinds of graphic primitives to create my drawing of a car moving down a road. I used lines to create
the different components of the road, a rectangle for the bottom half of the car, polygons for the top half of the car
including the windows, and circles for the wheels of the car. I then animated the car to look as though it is moving
down the road. 

Screenshot of the car (will need to open site to view animation):
